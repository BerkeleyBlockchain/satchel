## Description

Satchel is a mobile-optimized web application that leverages a crowdfunding framework to bank underbanked communities that may lack access to stable financial climates, but have access to the internet. Satchel combats hyperinflation and economic distrust by giving users banking functionality with the use of DAI, a cryptocurrency soft-pegged to the U.S. dollar. Satchel allows users to invest in both themselves and their local school, which operates as an economic hub for each community. By arming communities with the tools they need to adopt socioeconomic mobility at the individual and communal level, Satchel can redefine financial autonomy on the global scale.

### Technical Architecture

- React.js and web3 for the frontend
- Compound as the the Ethereum-lending protocol to garner interest for users
- Solidity for smart contracts
- MetaMask for authentication

## Features

### Current Features

Satchel currently has two user flows: That of the school and that of the community member.

#### User

- User can login with their MetaMask account.
- User can deposit DAI from their personal wallet into Satchel such that it can garner interest over time.
- User can withdraw DAI from their savings account in Satchel, at which point the garnered interest will be evenly split between the user and their associated school.
- User can see the current interest rate of Satchel on their Dashboard, which is updated upon withdrawals.
- User can see the exact amount of DAI they have contributed to their local school.
- User can see the name of their local school.
- User can see the projects that their school is currently running and utilizing their contributions for.

#### School

- School can login with its MetaMask account.
- School can withdraw DAI that has been sent to the school from the garnered interest of its associated community members. Withdrawn funds go to the schoolâ€™s wallet.
- School can create a new project that will be showcased to its community members.
- School can see current projects.

### Future Features

We plan to add the following improvements:

- User can take out loans from Satchel and redeem those loans.
- User maintains a credit rating that implicates their loan flexibility and is impacted by loan redemption timeliness.
- Implement a User and School onboarding process.
- Add a flow for a non-community-member to be able to interact with Satchel and contribute to a school in a developing region.
- School projects are created with real data.
- Multiple schools (not just one) are able to login and users are able to specify the school with which they are associated with.
- Implement governance such that users can vote on which school projects are prioritized funding-wise.
